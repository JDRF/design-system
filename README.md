# Local Development

#### Setting up
This will require that the master branch to be setup in a sub folder at ./design-system. This will pull the latest code, run npm install, and afterwords run gulp.
```
npm run pull
```

#### Running locally and editing Fabricator
Running locally, all files can be access via their full path, but it's recommended to serve them with the below command and access at http://localhost:3000
````
npm run serve
````

#### Running locally and editing Design System
If you are developing the master branch in a sub-folder called _design-system_, it's recommended that you run the below command instead. This will add a dependency on the master branch dist files and allow local development on Design System.

`serve-from-dev` will also watch your files in _design-system_ so you only have to run gulp in one place.
````
npm run serve-from-dev
````
# Pushing to gh-pages
````
npm run build
````

If you want to include the latest from master in gh-pages
````
npm run build-from-dev
````

# Tests
The screenshots should be generated before any edits are made to the source files. Once work is complete run the below command to confirm no unexpected changes have occurred.
````
npm run test
````

To run tests on specific files, add the flags `--test_dir=<NAME OF FOLDER>` and `--test_file=<NAME OF FILE>` to the gulp command triggered by the above command.

````
gulp --test_dir=<NAME OF FOLDER> --test_file=<NAME OF FILE> test
````

If there are NPM errors, try running ````npm install```` in ````./node_modules/gulp-phantomcss````
